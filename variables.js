//Exercise 1: Variables Declaration

//1
const name = "Xolile";

//2
let age = 26;

//3
const isStudent = true;

//4
console.log(`
            ${name}, 
            ${age}, 
            ${isStudent}
            `);
console.log();

//Exercise 2: Variable Reassignment

//1
let favoriteColor = "blue";

//2

//2
let sum, difference, product, quotient;

//3
sum = num1 + num2;
difference = num1 - num2;
product = num1 * num2;
quotient = num1 / num2;
console.log(`
            sum = ${sum}, 
            difference = ${difference}, 
            product = ${product}, 
            quotient = ${quotient}
